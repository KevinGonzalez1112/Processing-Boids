# Processing Boids

## Question 1

### Overview

Created an interactive environment where the user can control various parameters related to Flocks and Boids. The Boids exhibit natural Flocking behaviors, and the user can also introduce obstacles that the Boids will avoid.

### Controls

Flock parameters:

- Number of Flocks.
- Number of Boids in a Flock.

Flocking parameters:

- Separation (Boids avoid crowding each other).
- Alignment (Boids align their movement).
- Cohesion (Boids steer toward the center of their group).

Boid behaviour parameters:

-  Maximum speed.
-  Maximum force.

## Question 2

### Overview

Created an interactive environment where the user can control various parameters related to Flocks and Boids. The Boids will now also be able to detect colour flying over an image on screen and outputting the drawing onto a new image box. 

### Controls

Flock parameters:

- Number of Flocks.
- Number of Boids in a Flock.

## Question 3

### Overview

Created an interactive environment where the user can control various parameters related to Particles and Swarms. The particles are able to detect changes in colour and therefore make edge detection of an image possible. These Swarms of particles will follow wherever 
the user clicks on screen. 

### Controls

Swarm parameters:

- Number of Swarms.
- Number of Particles in a Swarm.

## Question 4

### Overview

Combines the logic set up in Questions 2 and 3.

### Controls

Flock parameters:

- Number of Flocks.
- Number of Boids in a Flock.

Swarm parameters:

- Number of Swarms.
- Number of Particles in a Swarm.
